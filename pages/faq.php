        <p><strong>Festival Map</strong><br>
      The festival map is available <a target="_blank" href="/pdf/map.php">here.</a></p>
        <p><strong>Autographs/Passes</strong><br>
      Backstage access is reserved for Artists and Festival Staff who need access to do their jobs. One great thing about Purple Door is that artists often will spend much of their time mingling in the crowds, visiting with attendees and fellow artists, and spending time at their merchandise table. It is important to respect the artists' time and only ask for autographs if they are at their merchandise table or specifically signing autographs. It is inappropriate to ask for autographs if they are enjoying a show or hanging out with friends and family.</p>
          <p><strong>Directions</strong><br>
      Directions to the festival can be found at <a href="directions.html">the directions page.</a></p>
          <p><strong>Dress</strong><br>
            We do not allow any kind of spikes to be worn in the crowd at the festival. We have seen many injuries in first aid due to puncture wounds from others wearing spikes in the audience. If you are seen wearing them on the grounds, they will be confiscated, so please leave them at home!<br>
          </p>
      <p>We also ask that you use discretion and modesty in your dress.</p>
          <p><strong>First Aid</strong><br>
            We have security personnel at Purple Door whose most important job is to keep the attendees of the festival safe. However, accidents do happen, so Purple Door is equipped with a First Aid Station with qualified staff to treat minor injuries that may occur at the festival. </p>
      <p>If you are under 18, you need to have an adult sign a permission slip before you can be treated. If you are not accompanied by an adult, be sure to bring along a parental permission waiver, just in case. <a href="documents/medical_waiver.pdf"> Download Form.</a></p>
          <p><strong>Food</strong><br>
            Food and beverages are available for purchase on the festival grounds. You are also welcome to bring in coolers and food of your own.</p>
      <p>Grilling is only allowed in the parking area near your vehicle, and it must be in a contained grill for safety.</p>
          <p><strong>Literature Distribution</strong><br>
          Literature distribution of any kind is permitted only from official booth holders. Regardless of the type of literature, please understand that this rule will be strictly enforced. If you are interested in a booth, please email <a href="mailto:info@purpledoor.com">info@purpledoor.com</a>.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

          <p><strong>Pets</strong><br>
            Pets are not allowed at the Purple Door festival. We ask that all animals stay at home for safety reasons for festival attendees and the pets.</p>
          <p><strong>Purple Door- the name</strong><br>
      When the founders of the festival were trying to come up with a name for the festival, they had a long list of possible names. At a Bible Study that one of them attended, there was a purple door. The name Purple Door made it on the list, and the name stuck.</p>
          <p><strong>Re-entry</strong><br>
      Upon entry into the festival, you will receive a wristband that will serve as your re-entry pass if you choose to leave the grounds. Be sure not to lose your wristband, there is a replacement charge of $30 if you lose it. </p>
          <p><strong>Scheduling</strong><br>
            There are a limited number of time slots to fill at the festival. There are many, many bands interested in playing at Purple Door. We pick the bands that we hope people want to see. We use the input of our attendees. (through surveys, individuals comments, myspace, emails, new bands, trends, etc). We check out new bands and yet have long-standing favorites.<br>
          </p>
      <p>Some bands we try to get and their schedules won't allow it. Sometimes (Inevitably) bands cancel. When the bands are booked, it is the desire of the staff of Purple Door that every band is able to make it and play in their planned slot. However, recording schedules change, other opportunities come up, travel plans don't work out, etc. It is because the band changed their plans, not because Purple Door does not want them. </p>
          <p><strong>Skatepark</strong><br>
      The skatepark will be open both Friday and Saturday. We have a great Skate Park available at Purple Door. Protective gear and a signed waiver are also required to skate or bike on the park. If you are under 18, a parent's signature is necessary. You can print out a form here to have your parent sign and bring it along to the festival. <a href="documents/SkateparkWaiver2010-Release.pdf"> Download Form.</a></p>

It is not permitted inside the festival grounds. Please be considerate of those around you. Anyone found under the influence of, or in possession of alcohol or drugs will be escorted off of the property and/or turned over to law enforcement.</p>
